This is the main menu of the game. Control is with the "up" and "down" buttons to switch the game buttons, and the "escape" buttons to exit the game.

The main game works on the following keys:
- _up_, _down_, _right_, _left_ — the direction of movement of the player
- _space_ — shot
- _escape_ — access to the main menu

Each color of the enemy gives him a different amount of health. When the enemy dies, there is a chance of losing extra life or improving weapons.
